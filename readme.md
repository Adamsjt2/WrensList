This is a simple CRUD app using MEAN stack.  It's a simple list of how my daughter feels about different things in the world.  You're able to add, change, and delete items.
To begin running the app:
    -first you'll need to install npm
    -then enter the root directory and run command 'npm install' to install all relevant packages
    -if you have the env file from here you should be able to run command 'npm start' to start the app
The app runs on localhost:3030
